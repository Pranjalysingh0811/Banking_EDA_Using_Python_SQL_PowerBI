# 📊 Banking Data Analysis – Python & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on banking customer data using **Python** for data preprocessing and visualization, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.  
The goal is to uncover insights into customer demographics, financial behavior, credit risks, and deposit patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw banking data.
- Categorize customers by income bands, credit risk, and other attributes.
- Explore relationships between key metrics such as loans, deposits, and customer segments.
- Build **interactive Power BI dashboards** to visualize insights.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
**Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- pandas, numpy → Data cleaning & transformation
- matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

**Power BI**
- Data cleaning (Power Query)
- DAX Measures
- Interactive charts & KPIs

## 🔍 EDA Process (Python)
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Replacing categorical codes with labels (e.g., GenderId → Male/Female)
   - Creating income bands using `pd.cut`
2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution plots (histograms, KDE)
   - Countplots for categorical variables
3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap for numerical variables
   - Countplots grouped by nationality and other demographics
